        <h2>About Zamboanga City</h2>
        <p>Zamboanga City is known for its rich history, beautiful beaches, and diverse culture.
        Zamboanga was chosen in 1569 as the site of the Spanish settlement and garrison on La Caldera (now part of Barangay Recodo). Spain granted the former Rajahnate of Sanmalan protectorate status against the Sulu Sultanate, its former overlord and the kingdom's name was hispanized into Zamboanga and made a city.</p>
